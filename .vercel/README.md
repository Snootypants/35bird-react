# Vercel Project Notes

This repository intentionally keeps the `.vercel` directory ignored so that developer‑specific metadata (`project.json`, `.env.*` files, etc.) generated by the Vercel CLI are not committed. Those files contain project IDs and tokens that vary per team member.

To work with the existing Vercel project:

1. Ensure you are logged in: `vercel login`
2. Pull shared project settings and env vars: `vercel pull`
3. Link this repo to the Vercel project (creates `.vercel/project.json` locally):

   ```
   vercel link --project 35bird-react --yes
   ```

4. Deploy previews: `vercel`
5. Deploy to production: `vercel deploy --prod`

If you need to reproduce the project metadata, copy `project.example.json` to `.vercel/project.json` and replace the placeholders with the actual `projectId` and `orgId` from your Vercel dashboard before running CLI commands.

> Keep the generated `.vercel` files out of source control—the `.gitignore` entry remains on purpose.
