**IMPORTANT**: Always read PROJECT-STATUS.md first to understand current project state.

Standard Workflow
1. When I ask for something, think carefully before responding.
1️⃣ Internally, create a clear checklist that you will use to accomplish the request.
2️⃣ Place this checklist at the end of the file toDo.md.
  - If the file does not exist, create it and include this legend at the top:
Legend: 
[ ] to do
[+] working on it
[x] done
[-] skipped {{-- reason --}}
 - If the file already exists, do not repeat the legend, just append the new checklist at the end.
3️⃣ After writing the checklist, start working through each item in order.
4️⃣ Only mark items as [x] done once they are fully completed.
5️⃣ If you skip an item, mark as [-] skipped {{-- reason --}}.
Do not remove anything from this file.
Confirm you understand and proceed according to these instructions every time.

2. The plan should have a list of todo items that you can check off as you complete them
3. Before you begin working, check in with me and I will verify the plan.
4. Then, begin working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid making any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity.
7. Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information. (timestamp this mm.dd.yy - hh:mm (military time))
