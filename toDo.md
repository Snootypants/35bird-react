## Setup/Bootstrapping Tasks
[x] Verify all dependencies are properly installed (`npm install`)
[x] Test development server startup (`npm run dev`)
[x] Test production build process (`npm run build`)
[x] Verify TypeScript compilation is working
[x] Test linting process (`npm run lint`)
[x] Verify all routes are functioning correctly
[x] Test theme toggle functionality
[x] Validate project data loading from projects.json

## Styling/UX Polish
[x] Review responsive design across breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
[x] Test dark/light theme consistency across all components
[x] Verify typography hierarchy and readability
[x] Check color contrast for accessibility compliance
[x] Polish animation timing and easing curves
[x] Optimize image loading and performance
[x] Test hover states and interactive elements
[x] Review spacing and layout consistency

## Testing (Edge Cases & Accessibility)
[x] Test with screen readers (basic accessibility)
[x] Verify keyboard navigation works throughout
[x] Test with JavaScript disabled (graceful degradation)
[x] Check for missing alt attributes on images
[x] Test 404 routing behavior
[x] Verify focus management and tab order
[x] Test with different browser window sizes
[x] Check performance with slow network conditions

## Technical Cleanup
[x] Run ESLint and fix any warnings/errors
[x] Remove any unused imports or dependencies
[x] Clean up console logs and debug code
[x] Remove unused CSS classes or styles
[x] Optimize bundle size and check for unnecessary dependencies
[x] Verify TypeScript strict mode compliance
[x] Check for dead code or unused components
[x] Validate semantic HTML structure

## Final Deployment Checklist
[x] Update meta tags for SEO (title, description, keywords)
[x] Add favicon and app icons
[x] Configure proper error boundaries
[x] Test production build locally (`npm run preview`)
[x] Verify all external links work correctly
[x] Check for any hardcoded URLs that need environment variables
[x] Optimize images and assets for production
[-] Add analytics tracking if needed {{-- not required for bootstrap --}}
[-] Set up proper caching headers {{-- deployment platform specific --}}
[x] Document deployment process

- Dev server starts on port 5174
- Production build compiles without errors  
- TypeScript compilation working
- ESLint passes with no warnings
- Routes functioning (home + 404)
- Theme toggle working properly
- Project data loading correctly

**Styling/UX Polish**: âœ… All design elements validated
- Responsive design patterns implemented (mobile-first with breakpoints)

- Graceful degradation patterns in place
- Image alt attributes present
- 404 routing working
- Focus management implemented
- Multi-breakpoint testing validated

**Technical Cleanup**: âœ… Code quality verified
- ESLint clean (no errors/warnings)
- No unused dependencies detected
